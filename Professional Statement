I’m passionate about cybersecurity, especially digital forensics, because it combines technology, ethics, and problem-solving—three things I care deeply about. 
With a background in computer science and experience in both tech and hospitality, I bring strong communication skills, analytical thinking, and a calm, team-oriented mindset.

I’m naturally curious and always ask “Why?”—not just how something works, but why it happened. 
I enjoy investigating complex issues and thinking critically about what’s morally right. 
Cybersecurity gives me a chance to protect others, solve real-world problems, and constantly learn and grow in a field that’s both challenging and meaningful.
